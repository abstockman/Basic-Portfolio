        <p><img src="assets/images/bryce_1.jpg" alt="Bryce in Utah" align="Left">My name is Bryce Stockman and this is a filler paragraph. Later, when I finish this site, this is where I will write a bunch of cool stuff about myself; like how I play guitar, love basketball, and father an adorable boxer pup. Now I am adding more to my paragraph to see what it looks it with more words. Words words words. Hopefully this is enough! If not, here is one more sentence: Coding is cool! It wasn't enough, sadly. I went to University of South Florida, which is a rival of University of Central Florida, which is where I'm attending coding bootcamp. Enough yet?</p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph to go above the first. It showed two paragraphs in the example so I'm just trying to make it look similar.  </p>
